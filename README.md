# landingsimple landing page

So I got this idea from a screenshot of someones gtk theme I was browsing on deviantart, I believe it was.

Anywho, this person had a similar landing page he had set as his homepage saved locally. I like mine to be hosted so I can access it on my phone and work PC just as easily, but to each their own I guess..

The whole purpose of this is simply to decrease "startup time" when it comes to firing up my browser and getting to the pages I most frequently visit as well as being informative. As you can see I've got two rows of @netdata badges for info about my two VPS's.

LG Nico

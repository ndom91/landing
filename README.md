# landingsimple landing page

Simple responsive landing page I built for myself. I've recently made this a PWA as well - checkout the manifest and service-worker js file.

The background is randomly chosen on each loading out of a folder called "wallpapers". I have it filled with google earth photos atm. 

As you can see in the screenshot it looks nice ;)


I use this as my homepage on most browser on my various devices.

The whole purpose of this is simply to decrease "startup time" when it comes to firing up my browser and getting to the pages I most frequently visit.

I also have my primary server info (via @netdata badges) at the bottom of the page.
